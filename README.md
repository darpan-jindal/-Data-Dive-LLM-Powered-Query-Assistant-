# -Data-Dive-LLM-Powered-Query-Assistant-
I have developed a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) using the Langchain framework and Googleâ€™s Palm LLM model. The unique aspect of this project is the integration of a backend database and the use of few-shot learning to train the model. The few-shot learning approach involved creating a series of simple to advanced queries, with a minimum requirement of only five. This technique significantly improved the modelâ€™s accuracy and provided the model with a comprehensive understanding of the database fields and data.

In addition to the LLM, I have also developed a user-friendly web application using the Python library, Streamlit. The application boasts a minimalistic design, enhancing user experience and ease of use.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:

Langchain Framework: Used for developing the Large Language Model.
Google Palm LLM Model: The core LLM used in the project.
Python: Used for backend connectivity and data handling.
Streamlit: A Python library used for creating the web application.
Hugging Face: Used for creating and managing embeddings in the model.
Vector Database: FAISS
This project showcases my skills in machine learning, natural language processing, web development, and Python programming. It also highlights my ability to integrate various technologies to create an efficient and user-friendly solution. I am excited about the potential applications of this project and look forward to further optimizing and expanding it in the future.

For now I have trained this model on a database containing cars details(model of car, stock, price , brand , color and discounts offered)

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like more information about this project. Iâ€™m always open to discussing my work and exploring potential collaborations. Thank you
